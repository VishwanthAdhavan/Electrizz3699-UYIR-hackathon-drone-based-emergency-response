This project implements an accident detection system using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The system processes video feed from a drone's camera to detect accidents in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time accident detection using a CNN model.
- Live video feed display.
- Alerts when an accident is detected.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a compatible camera connected to your system.
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python Training model..py
   ```
3. The application will start processing the video feed. Press 'q' to exit.
